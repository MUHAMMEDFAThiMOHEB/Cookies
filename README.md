representing a comperhensive revision for all essential topics in programming

## Projects Overview

Below is a brief description of each project included in this repository, derived from their folder names:

### 1. Armstrong Number
This project determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because $1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153$.

### 2. Count Vowels
This project implements a function or program that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, case-insensitive) present in a given string. This is a common exercise for string manipulation and character processing.

### 3. Digits_SUM
This project calculates the sum of the individual digits of a given integer. For instance, if the input is 123, the output would be $1+2+3 = 6$.

### 4. Factorial
This project calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$.

### 5. Fibonacci sequence
This project generates or works with the Fibonacci sequence. In this sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

### 6. FizzBuzz
This is a classic programming problem. This project typically involves iterating through a range of numbers and printing "Fizz" for multiples of three, "Buzz" for multiples of five, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both three and five. For other numbers, the number itself is printed.

### 7. Is_palindrome
This project is expected to contain code that checks if a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., "madam" or 121).

### 8. Scissors_Paper_Rock
This project implements the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" where two players (or a player and the computer) choose one of three options, and the winner is determined by a set of rules (Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock).

### 9. Similarity Percentage
This project might involve calculating the percentage of similarity between two strings or data sets. This could use various string comparison algorithms such as Levenshtein distance, Jaccard index, or simple character matching.

### 10. is_prime
This project  contains a function or program to determine if a given number is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).

### 11. max in list
This project is expected to include code that finds and returns the maximum (largest) value within a given list or array of numbers.
